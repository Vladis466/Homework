\section{Problem 1:}
One way of transferring files from a remote computer to yours and vice versa is to use secure shell, allowing a user to establish a secure connection with a remote computer in order to send and recieve information. WinSCP is a file transfer tool that uses a secure shell to allow its users to move files over a secure connection.

FTP or file transfer protocol can also be used to transfer files. This is more risky because originally it did not go through a secure method such as the SSH. When an FTP connection between two machines is made machine B can prompt the remote user for a username and password. After this authentication is complete, a channel is opened for the transfer of files.

\section{Problem 2}
Revision Control Systems are software implementations that automate the storing, retrieval, identification, and merging of revisions. It is used primarily for text files that are changed and manipulated often to save alot of time and reduce complexity for the user.

\section{Problem 3}
Redirecting: Used to pass output to a file. A redirect is an argument to a program.  What happens is that a program is ran and the output saved to a file. Then a second program  is ran using this temporary file as the input.

Piping: Used to pass output to a program or utility. s pipe seperates two commands.  An example would be a program being ran and all the output will be placed in the desired program, overwriting contents if they already exist.

\section{problem 4}
Make is the command that triggers the compilation of your code. Makefiles are useful because they allow you to specify some intricacies of how your code will compile. Makefiles are also efficienct because you can set them to only recompile files with errors when debugging. They also make the process of compiling your files much shorter using keywords.

\section{problem 5}
Syntax of a makefile:

\begin{enumerate}
\item:   The basic makefile has two primary parts. The target with it's dependencies and the system command. The makefile will sometimes use dependencies because if we only modify one file it is more efficienct to just recompile that file instead of everything incuded in the makefile.

\item: Makefiles also use variables. You can set these equal to values at the beginning of your file and they serve the purpose of clarifying the objectives of the commands we write. We can use the mwith the deferencing operator *dollarsign*(VAR).

\item: Finally, it is good practice to include a clean command at the end of your makefile to get rid of all current object files and executables.

\section{6}
The command 'find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0  file' will reade items from file instead of standard input. Stdin will remain unchanged. It will locate the files in the current directory and corresponding subtrees.
