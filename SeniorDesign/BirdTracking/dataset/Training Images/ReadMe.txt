Dataset for training SVM classifier
The dataset is relatively small, to get better performance, it¡¯s critical to build up the dataset up to 100,000 positive samples. On more important point is that when you try to increase the number of the dataset, make sure that all images with the fixed ratio between height to width. For example, the dataset I prepared is 1.0 as the width is equal to height.
