Unit tests performed as expected.
 
When executing the card tests, I noticed that playing Smithy would only draw three cards, and that it would decrease the size of my hand with every successive play, even though I was adding it onto the end of the hand.

Additionally, playing any card would increase the number of actions after playing it, instead of decreasing as expected. This gives every card an effective "+2 actions" in addition to its regular effects. However, Village doesn't add its additional action when played, it just adds one like any other, and doesn't draw a new card.

The only card I tested that would decrease the actions as expected was Adventurer. After playing it with 1 action, state->numActions is 0, as expected.
 
Cutpurse both doesn't add the +2 coin bonus but also treats the player as an "other player", forcing you to discard a copper, but this is not reflected in the hand composition.
