Used gcov for testing.

pre gcov testing bugs found:	
	For the most part everything seems to be working correctly.
	Tests are simple enough, I am confident in my results.
	Minor bugs were fixed regarding correct syntax for accessing pointers and initializing 
	the game when necessary. Used print functions to make sure the values were correct before
	simplifying the test cases.

All tests appear to be executed with high percentages for liknes and branches. This suggests that my code is for the most part necessary and working correctly.
One thing I noticed is that it might not be necessary to run some of these tests so many times, because we seem to be achieving the same result each time. 
My reasoning initially was that different seedings might affect the test results differently but so far evidence of this is highly inconclusive.
