I randomly chose kitchenr's code to test. After using diff on
gameResults.out and gameResultsRerun.out, there was no difference
found. So, I was able to run the same game more or less, with the 
same winner. However, using diff on testdominion.out and 
testdominionrerun.out, there was this:

103,108d102
< playCard returned -1:
< handPos=4
< card=11
< choice1=0
< choice2=4
< choice3=-1


So, there was one more error in my classmate's code. In particular, it is a 
late-game error, using mine to discard something(gold?) for copper, but 
failing for some reason. This corresponds to a bug I fixed, where the rules
disallow trashing copper for gold, but the code disallows trashing gold for
copper. Other than that there are identical bugs.
