What each unit test tests:
unittest1 - compare()
unittest2 - isGameOver()
unittest3 - getWinners()
unittest4 - updateCoins()
cardtest1 - smithy
cardtest2 - great_hall
cardtest3 - council_room
cardtest4 - village

I found three bugs. One is in isGameOver(). When I emptied three piles,
it failed to give a game over. I believe this is because the for-loop
fails to check the last one or two piles.

The second is in getWinners(). In a 3 player game, I kept player three
the initial hand, replaced player 1's hand with curses, and replaced player
2's hand with provinces. I expected player 2 to win, but player 2 and 3
tied.

Third, cardEffectSmithy(). This is an expected bug I placed into it: the
smithy card is not discarded.

The coverage is about 1/3. So, there needs to be many more unit tests to
cover it. Doing all the cards would especially be tedious, but necessary.
