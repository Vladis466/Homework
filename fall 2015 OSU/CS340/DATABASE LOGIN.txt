Dear All,

As promised, our DBA has created all the databases. Please see the instruction below.

There are a couple of things:

1. Please do not change your password. I may need to log in and check your data.

2. Please do not save anything you do not wish me to see in the database.

Have a nice weekend.

Best,
Eugene

Here's the standard blurb...

host name  mysql.cs.orst.edu

Web access http://mysql.cs.orst.edu - use your ENGR user name and
your db password (explained below)

Access is only granted from the oregonstate.edu domain. It's enforced
at the socket level by the OS on the physical db server. NO EXCEPTIONS.
You can gain web access through the phpMyAdmin page,listed above, from
anywhere because the db server is being accessed through the ENGR web
server. If you try to run scripts running on an off campus server access
to them will be denied.

The username is your ENGR user name. This is a db account and
has nothing to do with your ENGR account other than the user
names are the same for convenience.

Default pw is the last 4 digits of their OSU ID number (please change
it the first time you access your account). If you forget your pw,
simply e-mail support saying you forgot it and I'll reset it to the
default. Please DO NOT e-mail me the new password. I don't want to
know it and will not reset your account to that.

I'll get your database built on Monday Eugene.

Mike
