# Homework from my OSU undergrand


Hello,

This is a repository of work done primarily from 2011-15, with no intention of updating it unless I go for a Masters.
I've thought about taking it down but am a little too fond of that time in my life. 

*In here you will find some half-assed implementations,  
grotesque design decisions,  
rushed solutions,  
comments filled with desperation*,

**and a whole lot of learning.**
