# Homework from my OSU undergrand


Hello,

at this point this is a repository of work done primarily from 2013-15, with no intention of updating it unless I go for a Masters.
I've thought about taking it down but am a little too fond of that time in my life. 

*In here you will find some half-assed implementations,
grotesque design decisions,
rushed solutions,
comments filled with desperation*,

**and a whole lot of learning.**
